    <p>A video game is an electronic game that involves interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a two- or three-dimensional video display device such as a touchscreen, virtual reality headset or monitor/TV set. Since the 1980s, video games have become an increasingly important part of the entertainment industry, and whether they are also a form of art is a matter of dispute. The electronic systems used to play video games are called platforms. Video games are developed and released for one or several platforms and may not be available on others. Specialized platforms such as arcade games, which present the game in a large, typically coin-operated chassis, were common in the 1980s in video arcades, but declined in popularity as other, more affordable platforms became available. These include dedicated devices such as video game consoles, as well as general-purpose computers like a laptop, desktop or handheld computing devices. The input device used for games, the game controller, varies across platforms. Common controllers include gamepads, joysticks, mouse devices, keyboards, the touchscreens of mobile devices, or even a person's body, using a Kinect sensor. Players view the game on a display device such as a television or computer monitor or sometimes on virtual reality head-mounted display goggles. There are often game sound effects, music and voice actor lines which come from loudspeakers or headphones. Some games in the 2000s include haptic, vibration-creating effects, force feedback peripherals and virtual reality headsets. </p>

    <!--INSTR: Usually, you want all large blocks of text within <p> or <div> tags or some other tag that will let you specify to the web browser what type of content or category the text belongs to. So, I think I'd put that closing </p> above AFTER the </em>-->

      <!--INSTR: It's not common practice to mark <h> tags with emphasis or strong designations since you can specify how the heading will look with a style attribute instead. The <h> tag already tells the browser what type of text this is, which is the same job that <strong> and <em> do too... So you're basically saying that this text falls into two categories of text... I mean, technically it's okay and it works, but it's just a bit odd. It'll become clearer what I mean when we start doing CSS, I think.-->

    <h3>Rose</h3>
    <p>
    <em>
    Since Antiquity, roses have been associated with feelings. A red rose means "I love you", but a yellow rose stands for jealousy and infidelity. A white rose symbolizes purity, while the rosebud suggests young and innocent love and the moss rose, voluptuous love.

    <em>
    Symbolizing humility and devotion, lilies are the 30th anniversary flower - while lilies of the valley are the 2nd wedding anniversary flower. As the flowers most often associated with funerals, lilies symbolize that the soul of the departed has received restored innocence after death.

    <em>
    Symbolizes pride and beauty. A red carnation symbolizes love, pride and admiration; a pink carnation symbolizes the love of a woman or a mother; a purple carnation symbolizes capriciousness; while a white carnation symbolizes innocence and pure love.

  <h2>1917</h2>

<p>Since being stuck at home I've been able to watch a few different movies. 
  1917 was a movie I was looking forward to seeing and it was really good. 1917 is a WWI movie about two British soldiers having to run across the frontlines to deliver a message to call of a planned attack due to high casualty loss. 
  One of the main characters also has a brother in the division so it was important to him that he gets there as fast as possible.
   Due to the technology and resources at the time the only way to deliver a message like that was to actually just run which meant they had just over a day to deliver the message. 
   The soundtrack of the movie was amazing as well as the visuals in this movie. It was filmed to look like a single continuous shot which made it feel like as the view you were following them.
