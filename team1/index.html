                        Netflix called <em>Trailer Park Boys.</em> If you are into comedy I would totally recommend this show to you.

                        Having the opportunity to learn languages such as Java, C#, & C++, learning HTML and CSS was something I've always wanted to learn. When I was selecting courses
                        for this quarter, I was so glad that UWB offered a class that highlighted the basics of HTML and CSS. With the skills
                        I learned from this class, I hope to make a basic website in the future to showcase some of my work from my classes taken
                        here at UWB.

                        I am a currently a junior at the University of Washington Bothell. My major is Applied computing
                        and I have experience with Java and C++. Currently, I am working at the UW/Cascadia College as 
                        a student tech consultant where I help patrons with printing and common computer issues.

                        I am interested in computer networking and home automation. In my free time I like to game, make
                        music, or just sleep. During this quarantine, I am trying to learn how to play Chopin's
